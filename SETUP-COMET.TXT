# ☄️ COMET BROWSER - SETUP & BUILD GUIDE

This workspace contains both the Desktop (Electron/Next.js) and Mobile (React Native) versions of Comet Browser.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  **Node.js (v20+):** [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2.  **Java Development Kit (JDK 17):** Critical for Android builds. [Adoptium Temurin 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) is recommended.
3.  **Android Studio:** [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio)
    *   Install **Android SDK Platform 34** or higher.
    *   Install **Android SDK Build-Tools**.
    *   Ensure `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set.
4.  **Gradle:** Usually handled by the project, but ensure your system can run it.

## 🚀 One-Time Setup

From the root directory (`C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Projects\Browser`), run:

```bash
# Install all dependencies for both Desktop and Mobile
npm install
```

---

## 💻 Running Desktop (Dev Mode)

```bash
# Start the Next.js development server
npm run dev:desktop
```
The browser UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 📱 Running Mobile (Dev Mode)

1.  **Start Metro Bundler:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev:mobile
    ```
2.  **Launch on Android Emulator/Device:**
    In a new terminal:
    ```bash
    cd CometBrowserMobile
    npm run android
    ```

## 📦 Building the Android APK

To generate a production-ready APK, follow these steps:

1.  **Prepare the environment:**
    Ensure you are in the mobile directory:
    ```bash
    cd CometBrowserMobile/android
    ```

2.  **Clean and Assemble:**
    Run the following command to build the debug APK (easiest for testing):
    ```bash
    ./gradlew assembleDebug
    ```
    *   **Output Path:** `CometBrowserMobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

3.  **Build Release APK (Signed):**
    For a production release, you need a keystore. If you just want a release build without signing for local use:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew assembleRelease
    ```
    *   **Output Path:** `CometBrowserMobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`

## 📁 Project Structure

*   `/comet-browser`: Next.js + Electron codebase (Desktop).
*   `/CometBrowserMobile`: React Native codebase (Mobile).
*   `package.json`: Root workspace configuration.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

*   **Metro not starting?** Kill existing processes: `npx react-native-clean-project`
*   **Java Version Error?** Run `java -version` and ensure it's 17.
*   **Android SDK not found?** Check your `local.properties` in `CometBrowserMobile/android/` and ensure `sdk.dir` points to your SDK path.
