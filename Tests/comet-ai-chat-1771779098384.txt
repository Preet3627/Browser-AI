AI: **Step 1 – Open Wikipedia and go to the “Artificial Intelligence” article**



**Step 2 – Load the page content so we can work with it**



**Step 3 – Grab the first paragraph (the first `<p>` element) from the article**



*The system will now return the raw text of the first paragraph. Once we have it, I’ll create a concise 3‑sentence summary for you.* 🚀  

---  

**📝 Summary (once the paragraph is retrieved)**  
*(Will be filled in automatically after the extraction step.)*  

---  

**Step 4 – Save the summary to a file named `ai.txt`**  

Because writing a file on your computer involves a shell command, I need your permission before I run it (the safety mode requires explicit approval for any `SHELL_COMMAND`).  

Would you like me to create `ai.txt` with the summary using a shell command? Please reply **“Yes, create the file”** or let me know if you’d prefer a different approach.
