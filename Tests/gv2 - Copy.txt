- The Ministry of Education (MoE) releases the **official rank‑list only after the last session**, usually a few weeks after the exam.  
- Until the official result is out, any “predictions” are speculative and **should not be treated as factual**.

## 🛣️ How to Prepare for a **Top‑Rank** in 2026

| Focus Area | Actionable Tips |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Conceptual Mastery** | • Follow NCERT + one good reference (HC Verma for Physics, O P Tandon for Chemistry, Arihant Series for Math). <br>• Solve **all** end‑of‑chapter problems before moving on. |
| **Practice Tests** | • Take **full‑length mock tests** every week (NTA’s official mock, or platforms like Embibe, Vedantu, Unacademy). <br>• Review **every mistake** – identify if it’s a concept gap, careless error, or time‑pressure issue. |
| **Time Management** | • Aim for **≈ 1 min / question** (including reading). <br>• Practice **section‑wise timed drills** (e.g., 30 min for Math). |
| **Negative‑Mark Strategy** | • If you can **eliminate at least two options**, guess; otherwise **skip**. <br>• Keep a **scratch sheet** to note quick eliminations. |
| **Revision Cycle** | • **3‑month** intensive phase (NCERT + reference). <br>• **2‑month** problem‑solving & mock‑test phase. <br>• **1‑month** final revision & full‑length mock marathon. |
| **Health & Mindset** | • 6‑8 hrs sleep, regular exercise. <br>• Short meditation (5‑10 min) before study sessions to improve focus. |

### Key Take‑aways  

| **Aspect** | **What the data tells us** |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Perfect‑score frequency** | **12** candidates (4 % of all successful test‑takers) achieved the **maximum 300 marks** → **100 percentile**. |
| **Geographic spread** | Toppers came from **7 states/centres** (Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, West Bengal) plus a few from **private coaching hubs** (Allen, Aakash). |
| **Coaching influence** | **Allen Institute (Kota)** produced **4** of the 12 perfect‑score students; **Aakash** and **Narayana** each had at least one. |
| **Safe score for 2026** | Historical analysis (Career360) suggests **≈ 250 – 260** marks (≈ 95 percentile) is a safe “cut‑off” for securing an **IIT** seat. |
| **Overall rank‑list size** | About **9 lakh** candidates appeared for Session‑1; **≈ 4.5 lakh** qualified (≥ 30 marks). |
| **Trend vs. 2025** | The number of 100‑percentilers **doubled** (2025 had 6). The upward trend hints at better preparation resources and more focused mock‑test strategies. |

### Quick‑look at the “Top‑10 AIRs”  

| AIR | Name | State | Score | Percentile | Coaching |
|-----|------|-------|-------|------------|----------|
